This Repository contains a wrapper to access the SerialPort in MinGW.

Dependencies:
Windows (tested under XP and 7)
MinGW (not tested with Visual Studio and Cygwin)


Usage:
1. Copy or fork SPinGW
2. Include serialport.h to your program.
3. call openSerialPort from your programm
4. use writeToSerialPort and readFromSerialPort to transfer data
5. close the port with closeSerialPort


Example main.c: 
#include <stdio.h>
#include "serialport.h"
int main(void)
{
	HANDLE h = openSerialPort("COM5",B9600,one,off);
	char sendbuffer[] = "test";
	char readbuffer[100];
	//write test
	int bytesWritten = writeToSerialPort(h,sendbuffer,strlen(sendbuffer));
	printf("%d Bytes were written\n",bytesWritten);
	//read something
	int bytesRead = readFromSerialPort(h,readbuffer,99);
	readbuffer[bytesRead]=0;
	printf("%d Bytes were read:%s\n",bytesRead,readbuffer);
	closeSerialPort(h);
    return 0;
}
